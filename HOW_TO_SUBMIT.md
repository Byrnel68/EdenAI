# How to Submit the Website

## Option 1: Submit the ZIP File (Recommended)

A standalone ZIP file has been created: **`eden-ai-poster-standalone.zip`**

This file contains everything needed to view the website. The recipient can:

1. **Extract the ZIP file**
2. **Open the extracted folder**

The easiest way for them to view it:
- Open Terminal/Command Prompt in the extracted folder

- Open browser to: `http://localhost:8000`

## Option 2: Share the GitHub Repository

You can also share the GitHub repository link:

The recipient can:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`
